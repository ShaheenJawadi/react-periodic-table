# React Periodic Table


This app is developed using Next.js and provides a user-friendly interface to explore the elements of the periodic table in three different modes: Chemical Group Block, Element Images, and CPK Convention. Additionally, users can categorize elements based on their properties such as Noble Gas, Alkali Metal, and more. The app also includes a temperature simulation feature, allowing users to observe state changes at different temperatures.

## Features

1. **Chemical Group Block Mode:** Explore elements based on their chemical group block in the periodic table.

2. **Element Images Mode:** View elements using visual representations for easy identification.

3. **CPK Convention Mode:** Visualize elements according to the CPK (Corey-Pauling-Koltun) convention.

4. **Bohr Model 3D Visualization:** Get a detailed 3D visualization of the atom in the Bohr model when viewing element details.

5. **Categories:** Categorize elements into groups such as Noble Gas, Alkali Metal, and more.

6. **Temperature simulation:** Visualize how elements change state (solid, liquid, gas) with varying temperatures
